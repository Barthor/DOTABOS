# DOTABOS

This is a parser for the eventual dotabos website/application. 

Currently the program organizes a parsed combat log file into a text file for further manipulation. 

If you would like to add to this, please fork and contribute, but try to maintain proper syntax and spacing. 

If you would have any questions feel free to ask me.

You can email me at holycow2450@gmail.com
